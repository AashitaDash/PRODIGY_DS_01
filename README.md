Graphical Histogram and Bar Chart in Python
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to create and display graphical histograms for continuous data and bar charts for categorical data using the matplotlib and numpy libraries.

About the Data

Features
Generates a histogram for continuous numerical data (e.g., age distribution).

Generates a bar chart for categorical data (e.g., gender distribution).

Uses matplotlib for plotting and numpy for data generation.

Customizable plot titles, axis labels, and number of bins for histograms.

Includes basic styling for better readability (grid, black edges, alpha transparency).

Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This script was developed and tested with Python 3.x.

You will also need the following Python libraries:

matplotlib

numpy

Installation
Clone the repository (or download the script):
If you have cloned this repository, navigate to the directory where the histogram_plot.py file is located.

Install required libraries:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

pip install matplotlib numpy

Usage
To run the script and display the plots:

Navigate to the directory containing histogram_plot.py in your terminal.

Execute the script using Python:

python histogram_plot.py

This will open two separate windows displaying the generated histogram and bar chart.

Sample Output
When you run the script, you will see two plots:

Histogram: "Distribution of Ages in a Sample Population"

This plot will show the frequency distribution of a simulated continuous age dataset.

The x-axis will represent "Age Group", and the y-axis will represent "Number of People".

Bar Chart: "Distribution of Genders in a Sample Population"

This plot will show the counts for different gender categories.

The x-axis will represent "Gender Category", and the y-axis will represent "Count".

(Note: Since this is a text-based README, actual image outputs are not included here. You will see them when you run the script.)

About the Data
The script uses hypothetical sample datasets generated using numpy.random.normal for ages and hardcoded lists for gender categories.

For real-world applications, you would replace these sample datasets with actual data loaded from sources such as:

CSV files

Excel spreadsheets

Databases

APIs (e.g., the World Bank data mentioned in the original task)

You would need to implement data loading and parsing logic (e.g., using pandas for CSV/Excel or requests for APIs) to integrate real data.
